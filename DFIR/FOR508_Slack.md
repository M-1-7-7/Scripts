## Pro Tips
- Learning Forensics is a journey, not a destination. Technology is constantly changing which means new artifacts and missing artifacts. Be patient as you learn the topic
- "Legacy" systems have been the bane of my information security career. Segment, Segment, Segment!
- Be sure to scope an incident correctly
- Restarting a system may result in loss of evidence.
- Do remember that IOCs are backward looking... thankfully Threat Actors don't easily change their TTPs
- SANS posters are incredibly helpful - https://www.sans.org/posters/
- Threat Actors will try to hide in plain sight
- Learning to use the command line will enhance your capabilities.
- Never agree to playing a drinking game where you have to take a drink for every forensics tool created by Eric Zimmerman - https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md
- You could have added the recipe for Decode text and choose UTF-16LE (1200), since Windows uses UTF-16 Little Endian Character Encoding instead of removing null characters
- Learn to love Kape! It'll make your life so much easier.
- The default event log size is 20MB but you can increase this to 4GB.  It's possible to push a GPO Policy that will increase key event logs size.
- Write reports for your audience... don't write deep technical details when your audience is the Board of Directors
- When presenting your report to less technical audiences, learn to "paint a picture" or "tell a story"


## GIAC Exam (GCFA)

### Exam Tips
- Anything covered in a lab or on a slide (including its notes) is fair game for GIAC exam. The instructor’s stories, links in Slack, etc. are NOT covered by the exam. However, I and many other students do find the stories and links are extremely useful when trying to understand the content or dig deeper after class.
- READING all the course content is CRITICAL
- The lab workbook is also considered fair game for questions and is very necessary in Cyber Live.
- Definitely leverage the skip question if you aren’t 90% sure of your answer
- GIAC loves to have exam questions on slides that have tables, code, or any equations.
- GIAC will almost certainly ask one or more questions on specific Event IDs. I would build a table with each Event ID and book & page where it was referenced.
- Logon Type Codes are also something that GIAC will likely have a question on.
- GIAC practice exams and the final exam with give you a "Star" report afterwards. This can help you focus on areas where you need to study a bit more.
- AFIAK, it's still 90% threshold for the GIAC Advisory Board... and I believe over 85% to get an email about possibly becoming an instructor
